  { id: 1, name: 'Arcade Fire', image: 'https://cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/artist/0703e8e50373d950c7523869352a83c9/500x500.jpg', bio: 'Arcade Fire is an indie rock band formed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2001. The band consists of Win Butler (vocals, guitar, piano), Régine Chassagne (vocals, accordion, keyboards, hurdy gurdy, drums), Richard Reed Parry (bass, guitar), Will Butler (keyboards, guitar), Tim Kingsbury (bass), and Jeremy Gara (drums). Montreal percussionist Dane Mills performed on the EP and in early live shows. As of May 2005, the touring band includes horn players and violinists. The band’s trademark fashion consists in wearing rather formal attire during live events and a use of orchestral instruments. When asked about the rumour that the band\'s name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: "It\'s not a rumour, it\'s based on a story that someone told me. It\'s not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it\'s probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him." Win Butler and his brother Will grew up in Texas. Band formation Arcade Fire formed around the husband and wife duo of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne. Joining together as recently as mid-2003, the current line-up solidified in late 2003/early 2004, when their first full-length album Funeral was recorded. Before this an eponymous EP (often referred to by fans as the Us Kids Know EP) had been sold at early shows. The EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release once the band started becoming more prominent. Arcade Fire are known for their enthralling live performances, as well as its use of a large number of musical instruments. In addition to mainstays guitar, drums, and bass guitar, members play piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, keyboard, French horn, accordion, and harp. With several able musicians, the band take most of their instrumental diversity on tour and members switch instrumental duties throughout their shows. The number of instruments, along with a wide set of musical influences has provided a substantial number of resources on which to draw from during the recording process. The promise showed by the band in its live shows allowed it to land a record contract with Chapel Hill-based independent record label Merge Records. Funeral Without a major label backing, the success of the band and the album Funeral has been acclaimed as an Internet phenomenon. After a 9.7 rating from Pitchfork, Merge Records sold out their inventory of Funeral and it became the label\'s first album in the Billboard 200 chart. An early tip from David Bowie was also influential. The band booked small clubs for their 2004 tour but growing interest forced many venue changes, far beyond the band\'s expectations, and continued internationally into mid-2005. The MTV2 2005 Review hosted by Zane Lowe named Funeral Album of the Year, and NME named Funeral Number 2 in their list of 2005\'s best albums and "Rebellion (Lies)" the best track. By November 2005, Funeral had gone gold in both Canada and the UK and sold in excess of half a million copies worldwide, a phenomenal number for an independent release with minimal television or radio exposure. It has also surpassed Neutral Milk Hotel\'s In The Aeroplane Over The Sea as the biggest selling Merge Records album to date. Arcade Fire were featured on the April 4, 2005 cover of Time Magazine\'s Canadian edition, and hailed as a band who "helped put Canadian music on the world map". On April 2, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, they received the Juno Award for Songwriters Of The Year for three songs from Funeral: "Wake Up", "Rebellion (Lies)" and "Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)". Arcade Fire then planned to begin recording a follow up to Funeral in the winter of 2005-2006, having bought an old church forty minutes from central Montreal which they converted into a studio. Neon Bible In mid-December 2006 www.neonbible.com went live containing nothing more than a phone number, 1-866-NEONBIBLE where people can listen to a new track called Intervention. Built in the style of customer support lines, the number has other features including a contest and a chance to talk to a live person at a specific time each week. Then in January 2007, they finally announced that the new album Neon Bible would be released March 5th in UK, March 6th in US. The announcement was made with a video in the album\'s website, with guitarist Richard Reed Parry using a gramophone and a paper mask of Parry\'s own face, and sitting on Win Butler´s chair. After the announcement of the album´s release, the website was updated with a streaming version of "Black Mirror", new art and a few phone messages sounding like the band´s members. The Suburbs The band released their third album "The Suburbs" on August 2, 2010 in the UK and August 3, 2010 in the United States. It debuted at #1 in both countries. On February 13, 2011, the album won Album of the Year at the 53rd Grammy Awards. Arcade Fire recorded a song for The Hunger Games soundtrack (The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond), called "Abraham\'s Daughter". The song is featured in the movie\'s end credits. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200. It sold more than 175,000 copies in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It\'s the first theatrical film soundtrack to top the chart since Michael Jackson\'s "This Is It" debuted at No. 1 on the list. It is also only the 16th soundtrack to debut at No. 1 in the history of the Billboard 200 chart (those soundtracks include film, television, and straight-to-video efforts). Reflektor Arcade Fire and Mercury Records confirmed that they would release a fourth album in late 2013. In December 2012, the band\'s manager Scott Rodger confirmed that Arcade Fire was in the studio working with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. The official Arcade Fire pre-order website sets the release date on October 28, 2013. The band announced on January 18, 2013 that they were selling the church they had been using as a studio due to a collapsed roof. Throughout 2013, the band worked on the album in several different recording studios - including Murphy\'s DFA Records studio in New York. On June 22, 2013, Rolling Stone reported that new material from the album would be released on September 9, 2013. Everything Now Arcade Fire\'s first announced its fifth record, "Everything Now," on May 31, 2017 when it released the record\'s title track and lead single. The album\'s release came July 27, 2017. In the weeks leading up to the album\'s release, the band released three additional lead singles, "Creature Comfort," "Signs of Life," and "Electric Blue." Upon the week of its release, "Everything Now" reached #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the band\'s third-straight and third overall #1 record.' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Arctic Monkeys', image: 'https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5eb39f37a34b404169fdca52dc8', bio: 'Arctic Monkeys are an indie rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O\'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006. The band has released five studio albums, "Whatever People Say I Am, That\'s What I\'m Not" (2006), "Favourite Worst Nightmare" (2007), "Humbug" (2009), "Suck It and See" (2011) and "AM" (2013), all of which debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart. Each of the band\'s first five singles I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor, When the Sun Goes Down, Leave Before The Lights Come On, Brianstorm and Fluorescent Adolescent hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, Teddy Picker, only went Top 20 and their seventh single, Crying Lightning peaked at #12. The band\'s rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs which had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website. The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical \'commercial\' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK\'s (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success. The band\'s debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That\'s What I\'m Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis\'s album Spirit. On 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to \'fatigue\' and the other band members couldn\'t stand the constant \'missing his girlfriend syndrome\' so told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist, Nick O\'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band\'s remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson\'s permanent replacement. The single Leave Before The Lights Come On came out on August 14th, but only reached Number 4 on the UK charts, denying the band a third consecutive number 1 single. Their debut album "Whatever People Say I Am, That\'s What I\'m Not" won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades. Their second album Favourite Worst Nightmare was released on April 23rd 2007. It was preceded by "Brianstorm", the first single from the album, which was released a week before. Like its predecessor, "Favourite Worst Nightmare" sold more than the rest of the Top 20 combined, and - due to an error on iTunes - every song on the record appeared on the UK Top 200 Singles the next week. When asked about Favourite Worst Nightmare Alex Turner commented, "We haven\'t changed that much. It\'s still about making contact with girls or not making contact with girls". The band began to write and record demos for the third album in January 2008, Turner said "We had tunes that we\'d already been playing on tour so we recorded them. That’s six [songs]. We’re going to take it easy and start practicing over the summer and doing new stuff." The band premiered new material from the unreleased album during their January 2009 tour of New Zealand, playing small venues in Wellington and Auckland ahead of the Big Day Out festival. Their first show in more than a year was on January 13, 2009 at Wellington\'s Town Hall. In both cities, the new songs played were "Crying Lightning", "Go-Kart", "Dangerous Animals" and "Pretty Visitors." The full set list from the Auckland gig is available online. Also played was a cover of the Nick Cave song "Red Right Hand." During their last tour, the band had played new songs "Put Me In A Terror Pocket", "Sandtrap," and "The Fire and The Thud" live. Lead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the singer from the Rascals, Miles Kane. The band is called \'The Last Shadow Puppets\' The band released their new album Humbug in August of 2009, preceded by the single " Crying Lightning" They released their fourth studio album, entitled Suck It And See on June 6th 2011.' },

Frost developed his eclectic style of music playing in various projects throughout his teen years. He became a musician when he was eight, and started playing shows at 12, collaborating with a diverse array of artists like Austin icon Bob Schneider and hip-hop MC/producer Kydd. After hearing musicians like Erykah Badu and D’Angelo in his late teens, Frost began incorporating hip-hop elements into his blues-inspired stylings, interested in the idea of combining modern rhythms with classic vintage tones in his music. In September 2012 Frost decided to leave the University of Texas-Austin, where he was studying English, to pursue his solo career. He released a single, “White Lies,” which hit No. 1 on The Hype Machine’s “Most Popular Tracks on Blogs Now.” Max channeled the song’s success into the creation of his debut EP, Low High Low, which was released in October 2013 by Atlantic Records. Frost has stated that “The songs all connect to polar emotional states in life – highs and lows – giving the EP its name.” The theme continues in the production aesthetics of low-fi and high-fi, which continues as the basic concept in his music. In December 2013, "White Lies" was featured in a commercial for Beats Electronics.' },

In 2006 they released Magic Potion, as well as the lesser-known Chulahoma and a single version of Your Touch. One of their trademarks is their preference for simple, lo-fi recording techniques. They refuse to use big-name studios, and do most recording, producing, and mixing themselves. Most of Thickfreakness was recorded in about 14 hours in Carney\'s basement, using only an early 80\'s Tascam 388 8-track recorder. Often, their recordings still have background noises (such as an owl hooting).
